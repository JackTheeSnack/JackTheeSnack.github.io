            <h2>My Skills</h2>
            <p>  I am skilled in a multitude of things, which are mainly <a href="https://lbbancroft.schoolloop.com/" target="_blank">school-related.</a> I feel that I am talented when it comes to computers, such as <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?sdid=KKQIN&mv=search&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!226480911069!e!!g!!photoshop%20download&ef_id=Whi-QQAAAHn-viPY:20171127015952:s" target="_blank">Photoshop</a>, typing, coding, and I think that I am at least subpar when it comes to photography. I am also skilled at other subjects in school like Algebra and Science. While I do have some skills that aren't school related, they aren't as extensive as my school ones and aren't anything to write home about.             
            </p>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p> My hobbies include watching various forms of media, such as television or movies, and playing video games. A lot of these hobbies have inspired me to look into careers in those subjects. They have also made a huge effect on me since they have developed certain aspects of my character to make me who I am through their influence.</p>

            <h2> Interests </h2>
            <p> Some interests I have are science, technology, web design, engineering, and the film industry. I feel I am very passionate about these subjects as I have known about them for some time and they still never cease to amaze me. There are also certain career paths regarding these areas which would be very useful to have later on in life.</p>
            <h2> Family </h2>
            <p> My dad was born in Arkansas and moved to California when he was a teenager. My mom is from the Philippines and was meant to only stay in America for a couple months, until she met my dad. They met in September of 2002 and got married in January of 2003. I was born on August 2004 and I am an only child. My dad passed away in September 2013 and it is currently just me and my mom. </p>
